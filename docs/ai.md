- determine intent
  - high-level
    - "move to attack range"
    - "attack enemy"
    - "flee to safety"
  - good candidate for utility AI system?
- generate action(s) based on intent
- execute action(s) to completion
  - atomic actions are easier, non-atomic are more flexible

Can roughly divide this into two phases:
- think
  - intent
  - action list
- act
  - execute action list
